This is a project from our NATHACKS hackathon where we build a car racing game using Muse 2. The way this game works is that we use muse 2 to capture our concentration/focus level for the acceleration. The more the focus, the higher the acceleration. We even used gyroscope and accelerometer readings to determine the movement of the car. As you tilt your head to the right, the car will move right and if you tilt your head to the left, the car will move left. This game even has a NetCode feature which means, you can play the game in Multiplayer with your friends and family, with the Muse 2 headset

The game is made in Unity using Cs. We have also used modules like BrainFlow to help us calculate the readings of our focus level using alpha-beta waves from the brain. The brainflow API already includes an inbuilt ML model which learns and gives us the concentration level.

Objective of the game: To make a fun game out of focus level as we train our focus level to improve more and more in the form of a game.

we have attached a video of us playing the game to this repo. It is in output.md
